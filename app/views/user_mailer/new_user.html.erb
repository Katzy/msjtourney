        The MSJ Invitational is just over a week away, Feb 6th-7th.  We now need to have your roster entries in order to establish the seeds and set up the tournament brackets.  To make your task easier this year, we have gone to a direct online entry system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ABSOLUTE DEADLINE for getting your rosters entered for entry and seeding purposes is 3 PM, Tuesday, Feb 3rd.  Teams that have not submitted their entries by that time will be dropped from the tournament.  Please do not make us chase you to get your lineups in.
      </p>
